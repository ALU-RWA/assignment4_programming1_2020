<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
	Welcome to your fourth assignment.<br>
As always I appreciate your hard work and dedication very much :) <br>
Just a reminder that assignments are here to just give us feedback on how well <br>
we are doing and how we can improve and be better , it's not about punishing you for your mistakes :)<br>
And assignments are highly individual, plagiarism is a no no.<br><br>

In this assignment we are testing your knowledge about loops implementation and collection implementation<br>
as well as manipulation.<br>
If there is something that is not clear to you, please ask for clarifications <br>
before you start coding and remember to come to office hours( with me or our TA)  if you need help.
